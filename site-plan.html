        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>I selected this site name because the name of the town where we go to vacation is named Quend Plage.
            We share a house with my aunt, uncle and cousins. To be able to have news without having to call 
            all the members of the family to give them updates.
        </p>

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to share with the family how the house live even when we are not in it all together.
            In the home page we will find the meteo of the day and a link to the city web cam to see the sea. We will also 
            have displayed the birthday of the month or any news someone want to share about the house if there is a problem 
            or any specificity we all should know. We will also have another page with all the picture of the house or the 
            beach as memories with a description (modal dialog) that can be filter based on date or type (memories or events).
            We will also have a page with a form to share a new memories or an issue with the house. And lastly a page with 
            all the things to see around, good restaurants, hike, parc, the good season to see the local animals and activities to do.
            
        </p>
            
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>When was the last time we change the bottle of gaz?<br>
           Did the stairs got fixed?<br>
           What activity to do with the kids near the house?
